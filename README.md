Project4
  Project 4 is a program that simulates and displays how a variety of critters will interact with each other.
  This project focuses on Object Oriented Programming, with a multitude of critter subclasses that behave differently.
  The user will type in commands to the console that will force the Critters to move and interact.
  
Project5
  Project 5 is a continuation of project 4 but implemented through JavaFX.
  Running the program creates a seperate window that contains the world and a UI.
  The User will press buttons and type into the UI to create and control the critters that are displayed in the world.
  There is also an animate feature in which the world will step through on its own.
